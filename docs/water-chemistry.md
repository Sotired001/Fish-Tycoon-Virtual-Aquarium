## Overview
A minimal water chemistry model is used to guide resource management and gameplay: temperature, pH, oxygen, and cleanliness.

## Mechanics
- Each tank has stats: temperature, pH, oxygen, cleanliness.
- Stats decay or drift based on time & upgrades (filters, heaters).
- Fish species have preferred ranges; deviations reduce happiness and growth.

## Actions
- Filter: Improves cleanliness & slightly boosts oxygen.
- Heater/Chiller: Adjust temperature toward target.
- Aerator: Directly increases oxygen.
- Water change: Resets cleanliness & affects pH.

## Open questions
- How granular should the chemistry be for a casual experience?
- Should pH be visible or an 'indicator' with visual cues?
